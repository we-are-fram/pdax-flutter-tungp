### 3. Project structure:

```

├── cores
├── datasources
├── locator
├── repositories
└── screens
```

### 4. State Management: [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)

### 5. Run app

Find your device which you want to run the application on:

```bash
flutter devices
```

```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

Example:

To run mobile app on the device:

```bash
flutter run -d F36E23FA-5AC7-4783-9A6E-558C7222EA1B
```

To run app on browser (in this case, we use Chrome for running the web application):

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 6. Unit Testing

To run the unit test suits:

```bash
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To review the coverage of the test:

- Required tools:

    - [lcov](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lcov#default)

      ```bash
      brew install lcov
      ```
- Generate the page of test coverage result:

  ```bash
  genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage && open coverage/index.html
  ```

### 7. Integration Testing

To run the integration test suits:

```bash
fvm flutter test -d <device-id> integration_test
```
